# Comics Story Representation Based on Genre

Comic and manga books are usually classified into broad categories called ``genres'' according to their content such as comedy, horror, science fiction, etc. However, giving only one genre to one comic cannot express the detailed difference of the story. We propose a system for generating comics story representation as a sub-sequence of genres. We propose a method based on a deep neural network to classify each page into the corresponding genre in order to represent the comics story [1].
